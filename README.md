# Dime Game (Healthcare)

THIS DRAFT - WILL BE UPDATED THROUGHOUT 2022

I do not claim to be a licensed clinician and recommend this game based soley upon personal experiences when it comes to the following:
1). Deciding whether or not to ask someone a question.
2). Deciding a yes/no response to a question asked by someone else.

GAME DETAILS:

The traditional name of this game is called "The Dime Game" and has been used in Interpersonal Effectiveness, Mindfulness & DBT therapies.  
I did not invent it and do not own rights to it, but from my knowledge is public information that can easily be accessed by the internet.  
That being said, this game is intended to make two life events easier. The questions listed below are the questions you ask yourself.  
Bear in mind these are questions that might typically be asked by a licensed clinician.
A lot of the questions are easy questions and the intent when answering the question is to be mindful.  

TO PLAY THIS GAME:
There are two different sets of questions:

1). QUESTION SET FOR ANSWERING SOMEONE ELSE'S QUESTION

2). QUESTION SET FOR ASKING SOMEONE ELSE A QUESTION
