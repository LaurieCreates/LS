I am not and do not claim to be a licensed clinician and recommend this game based soley upon personal experiences when it comes to the following:
1). Deciding whether or not to ask someone a question 2). Deciding how one will respond to someone else's question with either a yes or no answer.

GAME DETAILS:
The traditional name of this game is called "The Dime Game" and has been used in for Interpersonal Effectiveness and Mindfulness therapies.  I did not invent it and do not own rights to it, but from my knowledge is public information that can easily be accessed by the internet.  That being said, this game is intended to make two of life's events easier. The questions listed below are the questions you ask yourself.  Bear in mind these are questions that would normally be asked by a licensed pyschological clinician in cases involving mental illness.  A lot of the questions are easy questions.  They are not intended to cause diress and if they cause you this refrain from playing, no exceptions.  The first being deciding whether to say yes or no to someone else's question.  The second being deciding whether or not to ask someone else a question or not.  All humans, including adults, young adults, and children can struggle struggle making these decisions.  The point of the game is to make a decision from a very mindful place.  
TO PLAY THIS GAME:
There are two different sets of questions:
1). First set of questions refers to deciding whether to respond yes or no to a someone else's question.
2). Second set of questions refers to deciding whether to ask someone a question or not.
